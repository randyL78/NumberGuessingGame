# NumberGuessingGame

> Build a console number guessing game that prompts a player to choose a number between a specified range of numbers. After the user guesses the correct number, display the number of attempts it took them to guess correctly.

### Requirements

#### Minimum Viable Product

- [ ] Script Runs without errors
- [ ] As a player of the game, I should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message, before or above the menu.
- [ ] As a player of the game, I should be continuously prompted for a guess until I get it right.
- [ ] As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess I should be told if my answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that I can narrow down my guesses.
- [ ] As a player of the game, after the game ends I should be shown my number of attempts at guessing.

#### Enhancements

- [ ] As a player of the game, my guess should be within the number range. If my guess is outside the guessing range I should be told to try again.
- [ ] As a player of the game, after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to play again.
- [ ] As a player of the game, at the start of each game I should be shown the current high score (least amount of points), so that I know what I am supposed to beat.
